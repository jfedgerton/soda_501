Hi Professor [Last Name],

I’m teaching a section of SoDA 501 (the program’s “data layer” course) in Spring 2026. Dr. James LeBreton and I have a shared Thursday 12:00–1:00pm talk slot (both sections overlap for the speaker). For the course, we need to invite Penn State colleagues to give a standard research talk—no special preparation needed beyond what you already present as part of your ongoing work.

Would you be willing to speak? If so, do any of these Thursdays work for you?

If yes, could you let me know which date you prefer, and share one paper/preprint (or short background reading) you’d like students to read ahead of time? If you have a tentative talk title, that would be great too.

The format is typically ~40–45 minutes plus Q&A, depending on your preference.

Thanks very much,
